# Git Auto-Deploy to Vercel Production

## Step-by-Step Commands:

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes (including the vercel.json fix)
git add .

# 2. Commit everything
git commit -m "fix: resolve Vercel MIME type issue and simplify navigation

- Fix vercel.json routing to properly serve JS/CSS assets
- Remove 4 pages from navigation (Device Health, Brand Performance, AI Console, System Logs)
- Keep only core 4 Analytics pages
- Update navGroups.ts and App.tsx"

# 3. Push to main branch (triggers auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

## What Happens Next:

1. **Git Push** → Triggers Vercel deployment
2. **Vercel Builds** → Runs `npm run build` automatically
3. **Vercel Deploys** → Updates production site
4. **Live in ~2-3 minutes** → https://ai-powered-retail-analytics.vercel.app/

## Vercel Console:
- Watch the deployment progress at: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Build logs will show the deployment status

## Test After Deployment:
```bash
# Test main page
curl -I https://ai-powered-retail-analytics.vercel.app/

# Test navigation works
curl -sf https://ai-powered-retail-analytics.vercel.app/overview | grep -q "Analytics"
```

## Fixed Issues:
✅ MIME type error (vercel.json routing fixed)
✅ Simplified navigation (4 pages only)
✅ Build optimization
✅ Asset caching headers
